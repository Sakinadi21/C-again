sma-compile time
run time-pointer required
sam-doesn't require any pointer
dma-memory can be fixed
sma- wastage of memory

In SMA,the compler is pre defined for how much memory is to be
allocated to a certain variable & these memory allocataed at run time cannot be modified during runtime

In DMA,the compiler allocates memory as per programmer needs and this memory can be changed during runtime of codecvtDma is on of the application of pointers
always remember to free the memory from the pointer once,you're done!
memory is dynamically allocated from the heap
