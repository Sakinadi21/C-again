In C programming, the preprocessor is a tool that processes your source code before it gets compiled. It handles directives that are marked by `#` symbols. Here are the main functions of the preprocessor:

1. **File Inclusion**:
   - `#include <file>`: Includes standard library headers.
   - `#include "file"`: Includes user-defined headers.

   Example:
   ```c
   #include <stdio.h>
   #include "myheader.h"
   ```

2. **Macro Definitions**:
   - `#define NAME value`: Defines a macro that replaces occurrences of `NAME` with `value` in the code.

   Example:
   ```c
   #define PI 3.14
   printf("Value of PI: %f", PI);
   ```

   Macros can also be functions:
   ```c
   #define SQUARE(x) ((x) * (x))
   int result = SQUARE(5); // Expands to ((5) * (5))
   ```

3. **Conditional Compilation**:
   - `#ifdef`, `#ifndef`, `#endif`, `#if`, `#else`, `#elif`: Used to include or exclude parts of the code based on conditions.

   Example:
   ```c
   #ifdef DEBUG
   printf("Debug mode is enabled.\n");
   #endif
   ```

   This code will only be compiled if `DEBUG` is defined.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - `#error`: Generates a compilation error with a custom message.

   Example:
   ```c
   #ifndef VERSION
   #error "VERSION is not defined"
   #endif
   ```

5. **File Line Control**:
   - `#line`: Changes the line number and filename reported by the compiler.

   Example:
   ```c
   #line 100 "newfile.c"
   ```

   This will make the compiler think that the following lines start from line 100 in `newfile.c`.

The preprocessor helps manage code by allowing you to include files, define constants, and control the compilation process based on conditions.
