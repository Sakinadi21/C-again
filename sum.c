1) int fact(int a)
Will it work? Yes.
Explanation: This is a valid function declaration. It declares a function named fact that takes a single integer parameter a and returns an integer value.
2) void multiply(int , int)
Will it work? Yes, as a declaration.
Explanation: This is a valid function declaration. It declares a function named multiply that takes two integer parameters and returns nothing (void). However, the function body (i.e., the block of statements) is not provided here, so it is only a declaration.
3) sum(x, y)
Will it work? No.
Explanation: This is an incomplete and incorrect function declaration or call. There is no return type specified, and the parameter types are missing if this is a declaration. If it is a call, there must be a function named sum defined elsewhere.
4) divide(m + s, n + 5);
Will it work? No.
Explanation: This looks like a function call, but without knowing the definition of divide, we can't say if it will work. Moreover, if m, s, and n are not declared and initialized, this will cause a compilation error. The function divide should also be defined correctly to accept two arguments.
5) sum(x + 2, 10)
Will it work? No.
Explanation: This looks like a function call, but it will only work if sum is a properly defined function that accepts two parameters. Additionally, x needs to be declared and initialized before this call.
6) void isPrime(int);
Will it work? Yes.
Explanation: This is a valid function declaration. It declares a function named isPrime that takes one integer parameter and returns nothing (void).
7) void sum(int a, float b)
c
Copy code
{
    printf("sum = %f", a + b);
    return;
}
Will it work? Yes.
Explanation: This is a valid function definition. It defines a function named sum that takes one integer (a) and one float (b) as parameters and prints their sum. The function correctly uses void as the return type, which means it doesn't return any value.
8) fact(int)
Will it work? No.
Explanation: This is an incomplete and incorrect function declaration. The parameter's name is missing, and there's no return type specified. It should be declared like int fact(int a); for it to be valid.


Summary:
Will Work:

int fact(int a);
void multiply(int, int); (as a declaration)
void isPrime(int);
void sum(int a, float b); (with a valid definition)


Won't Work:

sum(x, y);
divide(m + s, n + 5);
sum(x + 2, 10);
fact(int);
